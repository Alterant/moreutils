This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
thirty years ago. Currently it consists of these tools:

isutf8
	check if a file or standard input is utf-8
sponge
	soak up standard input and write to a file
ts
	timestamp standard input
vidir
	edit a directory in your text editor
vipe
	edit a pipe using your text editor
and
	print lines that are present in one file and another
not
	print lines that are present in one file but not another
ifdata
	get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output


Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
apprecitated. Here are some that are under consideration but have not yet
been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to include.

_
	Matt Taggart suggests that and(1) and not(1) be integrated into one
	utility taking a page from test(1)/[. It would work like this:

	_ file1 and file2
	_ file1 not file2

	Where any file can be "-" for stdin. Could also add "or", "xor",
	etc to this. This makes it much clearer which file is on which side
	of the boolean expression.

	If it's called "_" that should probably be an alias for something
	longer, such as lcombine. What exactly to call it is the unresolved
	question -- is "_" something moreutils can justify taking for this?

mime
	determines the mime type of a file using the gnome mine database

	(More useful than file(1) in many cases but would add a lot of
	gnome libraries to the package's dependency chain.)

z
	makes another program understand compressed files
	ex: z zxgv file.bmp.gz

	(Dare I take the "z" name?)

tmp
	puts stdin into a temp file and passes it to the specified program
	ex: zcat file.bmp.gz | tmp zxgv

add
	adds up numbers from stdin
