This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
thirty years ago. Currently it consists of these tools:

isutf8
	check if a file or standard input is utf-8
sponge
	soak up standard input and write to a file
ts
	timestamp standard input
vidir
	edit a directory in your text editor
vipe
	insert a text editor into a pipe
combine
	combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
ifdata
	get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
pee
	tee standard input to pipes
zrun
	automatically uncompress arguments to command


Its web page is here: http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/moreutils.html

Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
apprecitated. The web page lists some that are under consideration but
have not yet been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to
include.
