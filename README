This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
thirty years ago. Currently it consists of these tools:

isutf8
	check if a file or standard input is utf-8
sponge
	soak up standard input and write to a file
ts
	timestamp standard input
vidir
	edit a directory in your text editor
vipe
	edit a pipe using your text editor
and
	print lines that are present in one file and another
not
	print lines that are present in one file but not another


Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
apprecitated. Here are some that are under consideration but have not yet
been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to include.

mime
	determines the mime type of a file using the gnome mine database

	(More useful than file(1) in many cases but would add a lot of
	gnome libraries to the package's dependency chain.)

ifcfg
	find ip address etc easily without complex grepping in ifconfig
	http://edgard.dyn.fdn.fr/developpements/ifcfg.shtml
	(Tarball link 404 when last checked.)

z
	makes another program understand compressed files
	ex: z zxgv file.bmp.gz

	(Waiting for copyright from Chung-chieh Shan)
	(Dare I take the "z" name?)

tmp
	puts stdin into a temp file and passes it to the specified program
	ex: zcat file.bmp.gz | tmp zxgv

	(Waiting for copyright from Chung-chieh Shan)
add
	adds up numbers from stdin

	(Waiting for copyright from Chung-chieh Shan)
