This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
thirty years ago. Currently it consists of these tools:

isutf8
	check if a file or standard input is utf-8
sponge
	soak up standard input and write to a file
ts
	timestamp standard input
vidir
	edit a directory in your text editor
vipe
	edit a pipe using your text editor

Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
apprecitated. Here are some that are under consideration but have not yet
been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to include.

mime
	determines the mime type of a file using the gnome mine database

	(More useful than file(1) in many cases but would add a lot of
	gnome libraries to the package's dependency chain.)

ifcfg
	find ip address etc easily without complex grepping in ifconfig
	http://edgard.dyn.fdn.fr/developpements/ifcfg.shtml
	(Tarball link 404 when last checked.)

and
	filter a stream for the entries that exist in another file
	http://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/linux/linux-20050822.ars

	(Isn't there a way to do this with standard unix tools?)

not
	filter a stream for the entries that do not exist in another file
	http://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/linux/linux-20050822.ars
	
	(Isn't there a way to do this with standard unix tools?)

z
	makes another program understand compressed files
	ex: z zxgv file.bmp.gz

	(Waiting for copyright from Chung-chieh Shan)
	(Dare I take the "z" name?)

tmp
	puts stdin into a temp file and passes it to the specified program
	ex: zcat file.bmp.gz | tmp zxgv

	(Waiting for copyright from Chung-chieh Shan)
add
	adds up numbers from stdin

	(Waiting for copyright from Chung-chieh Shan)
