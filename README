This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
thirty years ago. Currently it consists of these tools:

combine
	combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
ifdata
	get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
isutf8
	check if a file or standard input is utf-8
ifne
        run a command if the standard input is not empty
lckdo
	execute a program with a lock held
mispipe
	pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
pee
	tee standard input to pipes
sponge
	soak up standard input and write to a file
ts
	timestamp standard input
vidir
	edit a directory in your text editor
vipe
	insert a text editor into a pipe
zrun
	automatically uncompress arguments to command

Its web page is here: http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/moreutils.html

Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
appreciated. The web page lists some that are under consideration but
have not yet been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to
include.
