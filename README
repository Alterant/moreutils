This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
thirty years ago. Currently it consists of these tools:

isutf8
	check if a file or standard input is utf-8
sponge
	soak up standard input and write to a file
ts
	timestamp standard input
vidir
	edit a directory in your text editor
vipe
	insert a text editor into a pipe
combine
	combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
ifdata
	get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
pee
	tee standard input to pipes


Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
apprecitated. Here are some that are under consideration but have not yet
been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to include.

mime
	determines the mime type of a file using the gnome mine database

	(More useful than file(1) in many cases but would add a lot of
	gnome libraries to the package's dependency chain.)

z
	makes another program understand compressed files
	ex: z zxgv file.bmp.gz

	(Dare I take the "z" name?)

tmp
	puts stdin into a temp file and passes it to the specified program
	ex: zcat file.bmp.gz | tmp zxgv

add
	adds up numbers from stdin

todist
	inputs a list of numbers and outputs their distribution, a value
	and how many time it occurs in the input
	http://baruch.ev-en.org/files/todist

	Not a general enough unix tool, probably?

tostats
	inputs a list of numbers and outputs some statistics about the
	numbers: average, stddev, min, max, mid point
	http://baruch.ev-en.org/files/todist
	
	Not a general enough unix tool, probably?
