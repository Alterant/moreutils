Description: additional unix utilities
 This is a growing collection of the unix tools that nobody thought

 .
 So far, it includes the following utilities:
  - sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
  - ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
  - vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
  - vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
  - ts: timestamp standard input
  - combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
  - pee: tee standard input to pipes
  - zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command
  - mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
  - isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
